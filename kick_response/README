Olav and myself found a problem with the current implementation of the BI.QNO30
and BI.QNO40. By defining the quadrupole as SBEND with a Quadrupole component,
when you set a tilt=pi/2 one needs to make sure that the sign of the quadrupole
strengh is INVERTED w.r.t. the sign of the strengh is the element would be
defined as quadrupole! E.G.: if the quadrupole is a focusing one, K is positive,
then the K in the SBEND with tilt=pi/2 has to be negative to have the same
effect!

After the access on the PSB few weeks ago, several BPMs in the LT-LTB-BI line
turned to be inverted as well as some others stopped working. Finally as of
today all the BPMs in the line are working and have the correct polarity.
Taken another round of kick measurements to make sure everything is as expected.
