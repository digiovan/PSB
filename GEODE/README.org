* Lines Definitions:
** LT  line start at the entry flange of LT.VVS10 and ends at the entry flange of LT.BHZ30
** LTB line start at the entry flange of LT.BHZ30 and ends at the entry flange of LTB.BHZ40
** BI3 line start at the entry flange of LTB.BHZ40 and ends at the entry flange of PSB.SMH1L1
*** Remember that all the calculation for GEODE are done in ring 3
*** The file how_to_calc_dist_BIxQNO60_BRxBHZ162.org reports the calculation to show how to pass from middle point of PSB.SMH1L1 to the middle point of PSB.BHZ162

* Scripts
** Just to generate some confusion in people there are 3 scripts depending from where the longitudinal positions are taken
*** align_withLonOffset.py is the DEFAULT script: longitudinal positions are from GEODE + longitudinal offsets

*** align.py: longitudinal positions are from GEODE

*** align_madx.py: longitudinal positions are from madx files from the 2014 repository, see http://project-ps-optics.web.cern.ch/project-PS-optics/cps/TransLines/Linac2-PSB/2014/

* Commands
** python align_withLonOffset.py -o rad -b > log/ltltbbi_offsets_rad
** python align_withLonOffset.py -o ver -b > log/ltltbbi_offsets_ver
** python align_withLonOffset.py -o lon
