!!! These files are ready and tested. Made by B.Mikulec, V.Raginel and O.Berrig"

The BT/BTP line from PS-BOOSTER to the PS
The BT/BTM line from PS-BOOSTER to the BTM measurement line
In the furture also a line to ISOLDE will be made BT/ISO

---------------------------------------------------------------

All optics are for protons @ 2.12 GeV/c
The following strength files are available:

For the BT line there are 5 different optics:
BT_BTP.str
BT_dump.str
BT_hor_emit_largeDx.str
BT_hor_emit_smallDx.str
BT_ver_emit.str

For the BTP line there is only one optics:
BTP.str

For the BTM line there are 4 different optics:
BTM_dump.str
BTM_hor_emit_largeDx.str
BTM_hor_emit_smallDx.str
BTM_ver_emit.str

 The structure of the files are:
    <>.ele   Element  file.  The definition of the elements/equipments
    <>.seq   Sequence file.  The layout of the elements
    <>.str   Strength files. The strength or currents of the elements - depends on operation mode.
    <>.dbx   Aperture file.  The apertures of the vacuum chambers.
    <>.madx  MADX     files. Set-up of a particular operation mode.

 Display plot:  >gv BT3_BTP01.eps


 NB! The extension for the MADX files is <>.madx and not <>.mad.
     The reason is that when the files are read via the web, the
     .mad extension is taken as Microsoft Access module and not
     as a text file. By using .madx extension, the files are inter-
     preted as text files on the web.

 *********************************************************************************
 Added new strength for the quadrupoles in the BT and BTP lines:
 New gradients in use from 2004 with Qv=4.23 (old gradients until 2004 were with Qv=5.23)
 and also a new BETAY0 = 4.22 m.
 Data from S.Gilardoni and C.Lacroix  25/3/2008  O.Berrig
 Many name changes, changes in element definition (report will be published) and changes in positions  10/1/2013 O.Berrig, V.Raginel
 The matching was improved plus several small name changes and other small improvements Jan 2014  O.Berrig, V.Raginel , B.Mikulec
