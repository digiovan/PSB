* Create the Dispersion Data
** Commands

python -i createDispersionData.py -f Dispersion_LTLTBBI_20140923/Datasets/ -d 0.00,0.0007,0.0012,-0.00015,-0.00049

python -i createDispersionData.py -f Dispersion_LTLTBBI_20150429/Datasets/ -d 1.373773e-03,9.237438e-04,4.855576e-04,0.000000e+00,-4.500290e-04,-1.006644e-03,-1.468516e-03

** Output
A file called "dispersion_data_1"

* Compare the horizontal dispersion between data/MADX/TRACE3D
** Command
python -i compare_hor_dispersion.py

* Remarks
The BIx.BPM40 and BIx.BPM50 have been commented out as in 2015 the
data are pretty unreliable and this means that I do not want to put
them in the comparison plot to avoid confusing people (and myself).
They should be added when data with reliable measurements have been
done.
